# About
This blog is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and it's built using [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/), [Ammonite](https://github.com/lihaoyi/Ammonite) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) (with a customized theme based on the [Blog Theme](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/blog/) by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo)).

The strategy on building this blog was heavily inspired by [Li Haoyi](https://twitter.com/li_haoyi)'s blog post [Scala Scripting and the 15 Minute Blog Engine](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/ScalaScriptingandthe15MinuteBlogEngine.html).
