The more I use [Git](https://git-scm.com/), the less I believe how I could work without it. Although its usage is widely spread (is there anyone out there using SVN voluntarily?), it's common to start with the basics (`fetch`, `pull`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, ...), memorize them as you've been told, and move on.

As with most things in software engineering, you can't use something properly until you have a good grasp of how it works. There's a difference between using Git and *using* Git.

The best way to start is to dig deeper into the commands you already know by using the `--help` option:
```bash
git <command> --help
```

You'll soon realize how complex and powerful Git can be, and once you go down that road, there's no coming back.

I'm constantly learning new commands or options, and I try to focus on them one at a time until I start using it automatically. It's also possible that I don't get to that spot, and I end up either dismissing it or, creating an alias to it, hence the subject of this post.

You can define global Git aliases by using the `git-config` command or writing them directly in the `~/.gitconfig` file.

I use Git aliases for two scenarios:
* shorten the most used commands (for instance, the command I think I use the most is `checkout`, which I've aliased into `co`)
* simplify commands with multiple options

Let's see some examples.

## git commit
### amend
It's common to amend commits, especially the *WIP* ones, and I usually don't need to edit the commit message. You can skip the message edition with the `--no-edit` option, and I use the following alias for that (credit goes to [Tim Pettersen](https://twitter.com/kannonboy)):
```bash
commend = commit --amend --no-edit
```

### fixup
It's also common while developing to make near-to-atomic commits that you'll eventually *fixup*. When you do so by rebasing interactively, you have to manually replace all `pick` commands with `fixup`s. But there's a way to leave a hint on `fixup`s that will eventually happen:
```bash
git commit --fixup <commit>
```
where `<commit>` is the first commit you'd include in a *rebase*. You'll end up with a history similar to this:
```bash
608601e - fixup! first commit
032d432 - fixup! first commit
c4d1469 - first commit
6ce0a04 - base commit
```
Then when you run `git rebase -i 6ce0a04` the prompt will show:
```bash
pick c4d1469 first commit
fixup 032d432 fixup! first commit
fixup 608601e fixup! first commit
```
I've aliased this into `git cf`:
```bash
cf = commit --fixup
```

## git push
When pushing changes you might need to use the `--force` option which, by the way, should never be used against shared branches. Instead, the `--force-with-lease` option will check that your local tree is up-to-day before you can overwrite it (check out this [post on Atlassian Developers blog](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/04/force-with-lease/) about force-pushing). To simplify its usage I have the following alias (credit goes to [Tim Pettersen](https://twitter.com/kannonboy)):
```bash
please = push --force-with-lease
```

## git diff
`git diff` shows the *unstaged* changes by default, but sometimes you also want to check out the *staged* changes (`git diff --staged`), or even all of them at once (`git diff HEAD`). These are my `diff` related aliases:
```bash
diffs = diff --staged
diffh = diff HEAD
```

## git ls-remote
Sometimes it's useful to list the branches and tags of the remote repository without the need of a UI (i.e. GitHub):
```bash
lsrh = ls-remote --heads
lsrt = ls-remote --tags
```

## git stash
This is one of my favorite Git commands. I mainly use it to store work in progress that I'd rather not push yet to the remote repository, when I have to temporarily switch to another branch to fulfill a quick task. I also use it to store local environment-dependent changes in configuration files, which I could easily rewrite if I switched workstations.

The *stash* is like a stack where you can push your current state to save it for later. You can then apply those changes and either keep them in the *stash* or choose to discard them.

While saving the state you can attach a description message to identify the changes each *stash* entry includes, by using `git stash save -u "my description message"`. You can then list the stash content with `git stash list`. To retrieve changes from the *stash*, you can apply them using `git stash apply stash@{<index>}` or apply and remove them from the *stash* using `git stash pop stash@{<index>}`, where `<index>` refers to the position of the set of changes in the *stash*. This is a really useful command but it can become annoying. Git aliases to the rescue!
```bash
sa = "!sh -c \"git stash apply 'stash@{$1}'\" -"
sp = "!sh -c \"git stash pop 'stash@{$1}'\" -"
ss = "!sh -c \"git stash save -u $1\" -"
sl = stash list
```
## More
I use more aliases, especially for `git log` commands but these are almost mandatory if you want to take advantage of the many customization options it provides. My `.gitconfig` file is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/pbassiner/dev-env/blob/master/dotfiles/gitconfig). The template I used to start my own is [this one](https://github.com/aserrallerios/dotfiles/blob/master/gitconfig) by Albert Serrallé.
