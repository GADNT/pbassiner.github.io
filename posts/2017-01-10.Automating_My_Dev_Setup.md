Switching to a new workstation can be a painful process until you manage to have the exact same setup you did in the previous one.

The last time I was about to upgrade my workstation I began by analyzing which stuff I had installed, which I'd need in the new one and I came up with a list ([this recent post](https://pbassiner.github.io/blog/my_dev_setup.html) goes over most of them).

It wasn't that long but installing everything manually felt like a waste of time, especially because eventually I'd have to upgrade the OS through an installation from scratch or even switch to a newer workstation again.

So I began to look for how did everyone else automate their development environment setup. Most examples were using bash scripts but I also found some that were using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), a configuration management tool like [Puppet](https://puppet.com/) or [Chef](https://www.chef.io/chef/). I started reading a bit about it and then focused on how to configure a local machine instead of a remote server, which is the common scenario.

## About Ansible
I'm not gonna get into much details about Ansible itself, mainly because my only experience with it is building the *playbooks* (Ansible's configuration language) to automate the setup of my development environment. All I can say about it is that it makes installation and configuration much easier than, say, using bash scripts.

For instance, the following *playbook* installs a debian package using `apt-get`, through the `apt` module:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/073a681726ce742db1b4e87de5f75cda.js?file=ansible_install_single_package.yml"></script>

The key here is that you can parametrize it using the `with_items` loop statement:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/073a681726ce742db1b4e87de5f75cda.js?file=ansible_install_packages_with_items.yml"></script>

Ansible also allows to combine *playbooks* so, for instance, the list of packages to install can be defined in a separate file and included in others.

## Automating the process
The applications and tools to be installed may be distributed differently:
* Debian packages available through `apt-get`
* Debian packages that need to be manually downloaded and installed
* `tar.gz` files
* Binaries
* Other package managers

That implies that each type of distribution method requires specific installation steps. After having the applications and tools installed, we can also apply a custom configuration like setting up our own *dot files*.

### Parameters
I chose to separate the installation steps from the actual things to be installed. In the `vars.yml` file I defined the list of stuff to install (for convenience, this is just an excerpt):
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/073a681726ce742db1b4e87de5f75cda.js?file=ansible_vars.yml"></script>

### Debian packages
Installing debian packages requires:

1. Adding the corresponding apt keys
2. Adding the corresponding apt repositories
3. Installing the packages

The `apt_key`, `apt_repository` and `apt` modules, respectively, let you do that:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/073a681726ce742db1b4e87de5f75cda.js?file=ansible_install_debian_packages.yml"></script>

On the other hand, manually installed debian packages require:

1. Downloading the `.deb` files
2. Installing them

The `apt` module can install the package from a local `.deb` file, which is automatically downloaded if we specify it as an URL:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/073a681726ce742db1b4e87de5f75cda.js?file=ansible_install_debian_files.yml"></script>

### tar.gz distributed applications
The applications packaged as `tar.gz` files usually contain a root folder related to the application version (i.e. `myApp.2.3.1_build33`). That folder might be referenced somewhere else, like a shortcut or a command, and that's likely to break if we upgrade the application. In this case I added an indirection layer using a *symlink*.

An example of this is [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/):
* The `tar.gz` file you can download is named `ideaIC-2016.3.2.tar.gz`
* The extracted folder is named `idea-IC-163.10154.41`
* The *symlink* to the folder, to have the same reference to the binary executable, is `ideaIC` -> `idea-IC-163.10154.41`

Thus, the process must:

1. Download the `tar.gz` files
2. Extract them
3. Generate a *symlink* for each one of them

The `get_url` module allows you to download a remote file and the `unarchive` module lets you extract a compressed file. Finally, with the `file` module you can create a *symlink* specifying the `state=link` property:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/073a681726ce742db1b4e87de5f75cda.js?file=ansible_install_targz_files.yml"></script>

### Binaries
Installing the binaries requires:

1. Downloading the binary files
2. Placing them in `/usr/local/bin` folder
3. Making them executable files

With the `get_url` module you can download a remote file to the desired local folder and make it executable specifying the `mode=0755` property, all at once:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/073a681726ce742db1b4e87de5f75cda.js?file=ansible_install_binaries.yml"></script>

### Other package managers
I use [SDKMAN!](http://sdkman.io/), a tool for managing parallel versions of multiple SDKs, to install [Java](https://java.com), [Sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/). To be able to do so you have to:

1. Download [SDKMAN!](http://sdkman.io/)
2. Install it
3. Then use it to install the desired SDKs

In this case, the installation and configuration is done entirely with bash scripts.

### Configuration
This is the most specific part, because it depends on the degree of customization to apply. I do the following:
* Set `zsh` as the default shell
* Create the completions folder for `zsh` and place the completion files there (for `docker-compose`, `hub` and `sdk`)
* Install `oh-my-zsh` by cloning its repo and *symlink* my custom theme
* *Symlink* the *dot files* `.zshrc`, `.gitconfig`, `.aliases`
* Create `.config` folder and *symlink* configuration files for `terminator`
* Create applications folder and *symlink* `idea`'s desktop file so the application appears in the HUD
* Create autostart folder and *symlink* `guake`'s autostart file
* Install Atom plugins

### Bootstrapping
Starting with a freshly installed OS we need to bootstrap the automated setup process. Since the Ansible scripts are stored in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pbassiner/dev-env) we need to begin with:

1. Updating OS packages
2. Installing `git` and `ansible`
3. Cloning the repository
4. Run the Ansible *playbook*

Those are the steps that the `bootstrap.sh` file performs:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/073a681726ce742db1b4e87de5f75cda.js?file=bootstrap.sh"></script>

### The last mile
While I was developing these scripts I had to execute them a gazillion times, and each and every time I had to:

1. Open a browser
2. Go to the GitHub repository
3. Get the raw content of the `bootstrap.sh` file
4. Open a terminal
5. Create a file
6. Copy the `bootstrap.sh` file content to the new file
7. Save it
8. Make it executable
9. Run it

That was clearly improvable, so I *googled* how to execute a remote bash script and ended up with this:
```
wget -qO- https://raw.github.com/pbassiner/dev-env/master/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

After that, running the scripts was just:

1. Opening a browser
2. Copying this command (I placed it in the repository `README` file)
3. Opening a terminal
4. Running it

### Maintenance
In order to test any changes in the scripts, while keeping the `master` branch as the working version, the `bootstrap.sh` file allows to define the branch to use with `-b|--branch <BRANCH>` (default is `master`).

The Ansible *playbooks* I wrote also take care of updating the dependencies. After the initial setup, running again the `bootstrap.sh` file will handle the upgrades of the applications and tools (you can check the complete `bootstrap.sh` file [here](https://github.com/pbassiner/dev-env/blob/master/bootstrap.sh)).

Anyway, from time to time I still have to check for updates of the manually installed packages.
