So far all my experiences in contributing to open source projects share a common trait among them, other than being really simple and minor improvements: I needed something that wasn't yet supported or implemented in a library I had as a dependency, or in a tool I was using.

For instance, I added support for [Slick](http://slick.lightbend.com/) 3.x to [sbt-slick](https://github.com/muuki88/sbt-slick), an [Sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) plugin to generate Slick table schemas from the database schema definition in its own DDL, because version 3.x wasn't supported yet.

Likewise, I added support for [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) 2.11 to [swagger-async-httpclient](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-async-httpclient), which automates the code generation of a Scala HTTP asynchronous client from a [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) API definition.

My last contribution was shortly after I began to write this blog, so I thought it was something worth to blog about.

## Context
While writing a [previous post](https://pbassiner.github.io/blog/my_dev_setup.html) on this blog I was making some changes to the script I use to generate it. It's written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) but it uses [Ammonite](https://github.com/lihaoyi/Ammonite), which allows to compile and execute Scala code without setting up a whole project nor requiring a build tool.

This means I *can't* use an IDE to edit it. Although I technically could, it would require to setup a Scala project (including dependency management and such) and that would go against the whole point of using Ammonite.

I use [Atom](https://atom.io/) instead but, nevertheless, I didn't want to give up all the features you get for free from an IDE. So I looked for some Atom packages that could help providing, at least, Scala source code highlighting and formatting. I found [language-scala](https://github.com/atom-community/language-scala) for highlighting and [atom-scalariform](https://github.com/jackhopner/atom-scalariform) for formatting.

## The issue
The highlighting worked as expected but when I tried to format the blog-generator script I got an error saying:
>You do not have a valid scala file open!

Well, that was somehow reasonable. Ammonite scripts are not *standard*; moreover, files have **.sc** extension instead of **.scala**.

## Research
Out of curiosity I took a look at the [atom-scalariform](https://github.com/jackhopner/atom-scalariform) repository to check out the Atom plugin code. I assumed that it would be easy to spot the file extension validation section and it was indeed. The code responsible for the validation was, at that time, the following:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/c8afc3af6f591702bf173354fa7859ad.js?file=atom-scalariform_pre_ammonite_support.js"></script>

Then I looked for the Atom plugins local folder (`~/.atom/packages/`) and saw there was a sub-folder for each Atom plugin I had installed. And within the `atom-scalariform` folder, the same file structure I just saw in the repository. So I opened the `atom-scalariform.js` file and added **.sc** as a valid file extension:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/c8afc3af6f591702bf173354fa7859ad.js?file=atom-scalariform_post_ammonite_support.js"></script>
Finally I rebooted Atom and *voilÃ !* Formatting the Ammonite script was successful:
>Formatted scala file!

## Digging deeper
Formatting was working but I wanted to customize it. Since the script deals with HTML entities using [scalatags](https://github.com/lihaoyi/scalatags) I wanted the code to be formatted accordingly:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/c8afc3af6f591702bf173354fa7859ad.js?file=scalatags_example_html_indentation.scala"></script>
Digging into the scalariform documentation I found that it should be supported through the `danglingCloseParenthesis` [property](https://github.com/scala-ide/scalariform#danglingcloseparenthesis). So following atom-scalariform [README](https://github.com/jackhopner/atom-scalariform/blob/master/README.md) I created a `scalariform.properties` file and set it up as follows:
```
preserveDanglingCloseParenthesis=true
```
I formatted the script again and it kept the HTML-*like* indentation intact, but I wasn't satisfied quite yet.

I had to define the path to my `scalariform.properties` file in the plugin configuration as an absolute path, which then would be applied to any file.

Even though is common to have a formatting standard per language, I think it's convenient to have a per-project basis configuration so you can make minor adaptations in specific projects.

## Improving
I thought that it'd be nice to be able to configure the properties file path to be relative to the current project folder. So again, back to the plugin code, I realized there was no hint of how could I do that and, after *googling* a bit, I came up with this:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/c8afc3af6f591702bf173354fa7859ad.js?file=atom-scalariform_getProjectPath.js"></script>
Then I added a new property `relativeToProject` to the plugin configuration and used it in the formatting process accordingly. I tested both configurations, relative and absolute, and it worked fine.

## Contributing
During the process I was already considering contributing to the project so I jumped back to the plugin repository and reviewed the `README` file looking for any indications on how to contribute, and I also checked out if there were any tests that I should update or even add some new ones. I found none, so I was practically done.

I forked the repository, made two branches (one for the Ammonite scripts support and another for the properties file path) since these were independent improvements, updated the `README` file in each of them and created the PRs:

1. [add support for ammonite scripts *.sc](https://github.com/jackhopner/atom-scalariform/pull/2)
2. [scalariform props file absolute/relative path flag](https://github.com/jackhopner/atom-scalariform/pull/3)

## Follow up
Several days later, the project maintainer [Jack Hopner](https://github.com/jackhopner) kindly merged the first PR right away and asked for some improvements on the second one. I proposed to simplify the configuration by removing the `relativeToProject` property and then considering the path to the `scalariform.properties` file to be an absolute path if it starts with a `/` or a relative path otherwise.

After applying those changes, the second PR was also merged and both contributions were included in the `1.0.0` [release](https://github.com/jackhopner/atom-scalariform/releases/tag/v1.0.0) of the Atom plugin, which was published shortly after.

## Enjoy
That's it, now I'm running Atom with a plugin that contains some code I wrote myself.
