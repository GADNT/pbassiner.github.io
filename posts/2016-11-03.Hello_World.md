Well, it's been a while since I considered writing a blog but I always ended up putting it aside because I wasn't able to find its value or purpose. When considering ideas for the actual content I quickly focused on its weaknesses, mainly driven by a latent imposter syndrome.

Then I realized that I'd never be confident enough to share my thoughts without having some doubts about its correctness. There's always gonna be people who disagree with my opinions or even prove them wrong, but that's fine.

So here I am. I'm gonna try to write about technical stuff mostly, but also about software engineering in a wider sense.

Wish me luck.
